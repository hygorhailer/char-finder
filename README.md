# Char Finder
A shell script created to solve a specific problem: the need to look up information about certain characters while playing Tibia. It’s a tool designed to make that process easier and more efficient. As with any script or tool, it’s created to automate a task and save time.

# Why the script?
I often use top-down terminals, so pressing F12 and executing a command is a simple and quick task for me. While playing Tibia on Linux, I found myself needing to look up information about certain characters during the game, that's why I created this tool.

It’s nothing extraordinary or spectacular, it’s just a script to solve this “problem”. New features may be added in the future.

Feel free to use it, implement it, or simply draw inspiration from the idea.
